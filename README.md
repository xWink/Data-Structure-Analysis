# Data Structure Analysis

### Purpose

This is a second year university assignment intended to demonstrate
the efficiencies of different functions of the array and linked list
data structures.

Final grade: 110%

### Functionality

The program functions by creating a simulation of memory in a binary file
and simulating dynamic memory allocation of an array or linked list in the file.
The data structure is then populated and tested with various functions to determine
its efficiency for the given function. Every time an array or list element is read
from or written to, a corresponding counter is incremented.

Functions tested:
- Replace
- Insert
- Delete
- Swap

A report of the analysis of these tests is available in the file Analysis.PDF

The C files in this repository allow for further exploration with linked lists and arrays in a binary file environment.
